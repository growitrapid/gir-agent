###

What is data analytics?

Data are a group of facts that can take many different forms, such as numbers,
pictures, words, videos, observations, and more. Data analytics is the
collection, transformation, and organization of these facts in order to draw
conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision making. Companies
need data analysts to sort through this data to help make decisions about their
products, services or business strategies.

###

Why start a career in data analytics?

Data analysts make sense of data and numbers to help organizations make better
business decisions. They prepare, process, analyze, and visualize data,
discovering patterns and trends and answering key questions along the way. Their
work empowers their wider team to make better business decisions.

###

What kind of companies hire Data Analytics professionals?

Organizations of all kinds, in industries as varied as entertainment, finance,
health care, tech, and more, need data analysts to help them improve their
processes and launch new products.

###

How much does this certificate cost?

Now INR 1160!

In India, Coursera charges INR 1160/month after the initial 7 day free trial
period. The certificate can be completed in less than 6 months of part time
study. Google does not generate any revenue from Google Career Certificates and
has made need-based financial assistance available.

###

Is this program offered in other languages?

This certificate is currently available globally in English.

###

What background knowledge is necessary?

None! Whether you’re completely new to the job field or have had some exposure,
a Google Career Certificate is the right program for you.

###

Do I need to take the courses in a specific order?

We highly recommend taking the courses of each certificate program in the order
presented, as the content builds on information from earlier courses.

###

Will you be teaching R or Python?

This program teaches the open-source programming language, R. R is a great
starting point for foundational data analysis, and offers helpful packages for
beginners to apply to their projects. We do not cover Python in the curriculum
but encourage learners to explore Python after completion if they'd like to
continue their learning journey.

###

Which jobs does this program prepare for?

One of the most exciting parts of being a data analyst is the number of
opportunities available. Nearly every company has the ability to collect data,
and the amount of data is growing larger and larger. This has led to a higher
demand for employees who can organize and analyze data to unearth insights.
Organizations have trouble recruiting for positions that require data analysis
skills, and demand for these jobs will continue to increase.

A career in data analytics allows you the opportunity to specialize, this just
means you’ll be focused on in-depth knowledge for an specific industry and your
day to day work will revolve around problem solving for that industry. Some
common titles can include: Junior Data Analyst, Junior Data Scientist,
HR/Payroll Analyst, Finance Analyst, Operations Analyst, Business Intelligence
Analyst, Healthcare Analyst and many more.

###

What will I be able to do upon completing the professional certificate?

Google Career Certificates are designed to prepare you for an entry-level role
in job fields like IT support, data analytics, project management, or UX design

- whether that’s doing in-person or remote work, at a small company or a large
  enterprise organization.

###

What resources will be available to help with the job search process?

In addition to expert-led training and hands-on projects designed to prepare you
for a job, you'll get access to interview tips, mock interviews and resume
building workshops, career coaching sessions and more.

###

Why did Google create this program?

Google had long faced an issue that many other companies also contend with: they
had open IT Support roles, and not enough qualified candidates to fill them. So
they built and tested a training program to provide pathways to jobs in
technical support at Google, for people with no college degree or experience. In
2018, Google launched the **IT Support Career Certificate**, so that this
training could be available to everyone. Since then, thousands of people have
completed the program, making it the top professional certificate program on
Coursera. 82% of U.S. program graduates report a positive career outcome within
6 months of completion, such as getting a new job, promotion or raise.

When Google saw the positive impact this program was having on people all over
the world, they wanted to expand into additional fast-growing, high-paying
career fields – Project Management, Data Analytics and UX Design. These
certificates, built and taught by Google, are designed to prepare people from
all backgrounds for jobs where there is great demand for qualified candidates.
Like the IT Support Certificate, no relevant experience is required.
